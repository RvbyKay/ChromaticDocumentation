## Initial update (4/29/19 - 5/9/19)
We are Team Sonder and we are working on a game called Chromatic.
This week we were able to iron out the main theme of our game as well as the main mechanics. We made a paper prototype that covered the main mechanics and started on the digital prototype.

The roles for each team member has been split up as follows:
* Emily Krasser as the art person
* Kayla Sprague as the script technician
* Sufiah Ahmad as the ~torturer~ puzzlemaster
* All of us will be contributing to the main creation of the game

To Do list for this week:
[ ] Impliment item pickup and inventory
[ ] Impliment NPC interactions
[ ] Start implimenting puzzle 1
[ ] Impliment puzzle win condition

Here are more pictures from the start of this process :) :
